# Summary
Chrysalis is a C compiler for x86_64 assembly. In other words it translates C code to x86_64 assembly (NASM syntax).  
It is built purely for the joy of learning about compiler design and this is not meant to be used.

# Roadmap
I'm using the method described in this [suite of posts](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html) that is based on Abdulaziz Ghuloumâ€™s ["An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction"](http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf) as a roadmap.  
So the project will be divided into stages and each stage will implement new language features.

## Stage 1
At the end of this stage the compiler should be able to compile a simple program with a main function that returns an integer. (See below example)
```
int main()
{
    return 2;
}
```
This stage is made of several steps:  
- [x] Chrysalis can tokenize (or lex) all stage 1 examples in the test suite.  
- [ ] Chrysalis can parse a list of tokens to return an AST (abstract syntax tree).  
- [ ] Using the AST, Chrysalis can generate x86_64 assembly code.

## Future work
The features coming after stage 1 are yet to be decided.
